A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation (e.g. Apple, Netflix, Amazon).

This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares."

Stocks are bought and sold predominantly on stock exchanges, though there can be private sales as well, and are the foundation of many individual investors' portfolios.

These transactions have to conform to government regulations which are meant to protect investors from fraudulent practices. When you own stock in a company, you are called a shareholder because you share in the company's profits.

Public companies sell their stock through a stock market exchange, like the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange.

Investors can then buy and sell these shares among themselves through stockbrokers.
The stock exchanges track the supply and demand of each company's stock, which directly affects the stock's price.
Stock prices fluctuate throughout the day, but investors who own stock hope that over time, the stock will increase in value.
However, not every company or stock does so, companies can lose value or go out of business completely.

When that happens, stock investors may lose all or part of their investment.That's why it's important for investors to spread their money around, buying stock in many different companies rather than focusing on just one. This is also called a portfolio.
