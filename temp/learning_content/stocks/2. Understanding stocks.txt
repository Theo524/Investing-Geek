The primary reason that people buy shares of companies is to make money. The idea is to buy low and sell high. 
For instance, if you buy 100 shares of Company B stock valued at $25 each, you will have made an initial investment totaling $2,500. 
Say the value of the share increases to 50$. Your profit will be of $2,500.
 

There is indeed more to why people buy stocks, here are some other reasons:

	- Investing in stocks is an excellent way to grow wealth. For long-term investors, stocks are a good investment even during periods of market volatility

	 - You can get rich with stocks, you just need to take the risk. You can grow wealth by putting your money into the stock market over a long timeframe.

	 - It Doesn't Cost Much to Get Started

	 - Protect. Taxes and inflation can impact your wealth.

	 - Stocks Are Designed To Go Up In Price, the larger indexes including the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 are updated periodically. Companies that are not performing are pulled out of the indexes and are replaced by companies that are being traded more frequently—among other factors. This ensures that the major indexes are always populated by companies that are earning money, and being traded frequently.

	 - You don't Have to Be a Genius. While an experienced investor may be able to grow their money faster than you—that doesn't mean you can't buy stocks! And you don't need to be a Chartered Financial Analyst, portfolio manager or the next Warren Buffett to invest in stocks. Also, buying stocks and making money with them is clearly much easier than building a successful business from scratch! To invest in a company's stock you must read their annual report (which you can easily find online), set some money aside and understand basic math.

	 - Another reason why people buy stocks is to support a company they like. It is funny to think of investing for sentimental reasons, but if you’re the type of person who likes a product or a company and you wish to help ensure that it stays successful within the market, then this reason for stock investment describes you. Some people also want the power to help in making company decisions and this will happen when you become a shareholder. Shareolders can attend meetings that help the company they invest in make decisions that affect its income.
