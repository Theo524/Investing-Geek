An initial public offering, or IPO, generally refers to when a company first sells its shares to the public.
An IPO allows a company to raise capital from public investors.

Before an IPO, a company is considered private. 
As a pre-IPO private company, the business has grown with a relatively small number of shareholders including early investors like the founders, family, and friends along with professional investors such as venture capitalists or angel investors.

An IPO is a big step for a company as it provides the company with access to raising a lot of money.
This gives the company a greater ability to grow and expand. 
The increased transparency and share listing credibility can also be a factor in helping it obtain better terms when seeking borrowed funds as well.
