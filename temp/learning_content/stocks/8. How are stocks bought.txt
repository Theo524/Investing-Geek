The easiest way to buy stocks is through an online stockbroker. 
After opening and funding your account, you can buy stocks through the broker’s website in a matter of minutes.

It's as easy as online banking. You apply for an account, provide identification, and choose a funding method.


Once you’ve set up and funded your brokerage account, you chose your stocks. 
A good place to start is by researching companies you already know from your experiences as a consumer. However, the objective is simple: You’re looking for companies of which you want to become a part owner.

Once you’ve identified these companies, your research begins. Start with the company’s annual report. 
The letter will give you a general narrative of what’s happening with the business and provide context for the numbers in the report.

Most of the data you need to analyse the company will be available on your broker's website, such as quarterly earnings reports and recent news. 
Most online brokers also provide instructions on how to utilise their tools and even basic stock seminars that you can join.
